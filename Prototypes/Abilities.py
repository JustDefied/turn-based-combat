"""
This class currently does not create its own objects #will it need to for buffs/debuffs/DoT abilities?
Contains all info about abilities
All methods that are considered related to  particular abilities/moves should also be kept here.

Unit.choose_target() will call Ability.targeted(skill, target), which will call the needed methods.
All combat calculations and Unit attribute modifications (except initial mana cost) will be handled here.

Abilities (moves) should follow this format:

( "NAME", ["TARGET_TYPE", "TARGET_TEAM"],["DMG_BASE", "DMG_ROLL"], "MP", "HEAL"                     ####SUBJECT TO CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF CREATED ABILITIES

TARGET [0]:
    TARGET_TYPE [0]     - (int) 0 = self,       1 = single,     2 = multiple,   3 =  all
    TARGET_TEAM [1]     - (int) 0 = own team,   1 = enemy team (ignore if TARGET_TYPE = self)
DAMAGE [1]:
    DMG_BASE [0]         - (int) base damage is added onto unit's attack stat
    DMG_ROLL [1]         - (int) amount by which base damage may vary each way,
                                i.e. DMG_BASE Â± DMG ROLL = Damage range (0 for just base dmg) 
MP [2]              - (int) MP required (0 for none)
HEAL [3]            - (int) HP healed (0 for none)
