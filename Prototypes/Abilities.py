"""
This class currently does not create its own objects #will it need to for buffs/debuffs/DoT abilities?
Contains all info about abilities
All methods that are considered related to  particular abilities/moves should also be kept here.

Unit.choose_target() will call Ability.targeted(skill, target), which will call the needed methods.
All combat calculations and Unit attribute modifications (except initial mana cost) will be handled here.

Abilities (moves) should follow this format:

( "NAME", ["TARGET_TYPE", "TARGET_TEAM"],["DMG_BASE", "DMG_ROLL"], "MP", "HEAL"                     ####SUBJECT TO CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF CREATED ABILITIES

TARGET [0]:
    TARGET_TYPE [0]     - (int) 0 = self,       1 = single,     2 = multiple,   3 = team (units in the team will no be differentiated),   4 =  all (units will not be differentiated)
    TARGET_ENEMY [1] - (boolean) True if targets enemies, False if it targets allies (ignore if TARGET_TYPE = self or all)
DAMAGE [1]:           
    DMG_BOOL [0]         - (boolean) True if move does initial damage, False otherwise
    DMG_BASE [1]         - (int) base damage is added onto unit's attack stat
    DMG_ROLL [2]         - (int) amount by which base damage may deviate each way, i.e. DMG_BASE Â± DMG ROLL = Damage range (0 for no deviation) 
MP [2]              - (int) MP required (0 for none)
HEAL [3]            - (int) HP healed (0 for none)
