"""
All ability effects (except initial mana cost) will be handled here.
Entering point into this class is through Unit.choose_move(), where an Abilityobject is created, and then its determine_targets() method is called



Class methods:
    - get_attr(skill_name, ATTRIBUTE_NAME): Uses ATTRIBUTE_NAME_LIST and ability_dict to get an index and then value of a skill's attribute
    - get_flat_list(nested_list): helps flatten nested lists for easier iteration
----damage-related class methods------------
    - select_target(ability_name, target_team): displays available targets (in targeted team and alive) and returns a unit from user input
    - damage_target(damage_amount, target): subtracts damage from target's HP
    - heal_target(heal_amount, target): adds damage to target's HP
    - check_abilityList(ability): 

Instance methods:
    - y.determine_targets(move_name):  Determine available target/s, calling select_target if needed, then calls Ability.targeted() or other Ability methods for damage calculations/ability mechanics)
    - y.targeted(target_list, caster): Displays available targets then gets target unit from user input
    - y.initial_dmg(target): calculates damage range from DMG_BASE and DMG_ROLL, gets random damage from that range and calls damage_target()
    - y.initial_heal(target): gets HEAL and calls heal_target()

Abilities should follow this format:
( "NAME", ["TARGET_TYPE", "TARGET_ENEMY", "TARGET_NUM"], ["DMG_BOOL", "DMG_BASE", "DMG_ROLL"], "MP", "HEAL", ["SPECIAL", "LASTS"]     #SUBJECT TO CHANGE ACCORDING TO THE NEEDS OF CREATED ABILITIES

    TARGET_ENEMY [1] - (boolean) True if targets enemies, False if it targets allies (use x if TARGET_TYPE = self, all )
    TARGET_NUM [2]      - (int) Number of targets to target if TARGET_TYPE = multiple (use x if otherwise)
DAMAGE [1]:           
    DMG_BOOL [0]         - (boolean) True if move does initial damage, False otherwise
    DMG_BASE [1]         - (int) base damage of this ability. This is added onto the ATK of the unit
    DMG_ROLL [2]         - (int) amount by which base damage may deviate each way, i.e. DMG_BASE Â± DMG ROLL = Damage range (0 for no deviation) 
MP [2]              - (int) MP required (0 for none)
HEAL [3]            - (int) HP healed (x for none)
OTHER [4]:      
    SPECIAL [0]     - (boolean) True if ability will require its own method (i.e. it has unique mechanics not covered by basic ones), False otherwise
    LASTS [1]       - (int)  Number of moves (target moves, ending at the end of last one) this ability will last for, e.g. for a buff, or damage over time (1 is default)
