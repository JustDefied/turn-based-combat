"""
TO DO:
    - update docstrings......
    - Ability
        - TARGET_TYPE multiple needs to be implemented
        - add new abiltiy attribute BUFF_TRIGGER_ON for buffs, for when a buff should lose duration (turns_left)
            - if loses per caster turn, no changes needed (this is default)
            - if loses when being attacked, when another unit is targeted, 
                - first check if targetting ability is ATTACK_TYPE = "NORMAL" or "MAGIC", 
                - check target ability queue for IS_BUFF = TRUEs, and TRIGGER_ON = 1's then access those abilties, and -1 their turns_left
        - buff prompt dict
        - make abilities that use all ability attributes i.e. DMG_IS_PERCENT and DMG_TYPE
        - how will ability_ID work?
        - adding unit.target_Ability_queue, (to get Poison to show accumulated damage in one line rather than in seperate lines for each stack)
    - Unit
        - display_buff_prompts() should get prompts from a dicitonary rather than if/elifs
        - is SPEED needed?

v0.6.2 
Changes:
    Units:
    - added randomized names for all created units (names_list in Unit.create_units())
    - moved mp usage into unit.initial_cast() so that it is only taken if cast is successful
    Abilities:
    - shortened some variable names in Ability
        - AttributeValueDict > AttrValDict
        - ATTRIBUTE_NAME_LIST > ATTR_NAME_LIST
        - ability_dict > aDict
    - changed check_Ability_queue() so that it procs abilities in reverse (so all buffs proc before the oldest can be removed)
    - ability.check_stacks() is now only called if the ability is successful (this only applies to buffs)
    - unit.modify_buff_stacks_dict is now only used at two points, in check_stacks() (called by inital_cast()), and in cast_on_target() if ability expires
    - added ability attribute CAN_DODGE in 'others' section, which signifies if dodge should be considered (ability_dodged() is called regardless, but will return False if CAN_DODGE = False)
    - ability.special_mapDict now maps abilities to their respective methods
    - added ability.buff_stat_modifier() which takes values from Ability.buffDict to modify unit stats  
    - removed unit.comp_move(), computer will now use choose_move()
        - is_multiplayer will decide whether team 2 is user or computer
        - computer goes through same method calls (with altered blocks)
        - computer will currently always choose moveList's index 1 move and a random enemy
    - changed when display_health() is used (once at beginning of choose_move, once at the end)
    - user is required to press enter after every move (otherwise text moves too fast) 

v0.6.3
Changes:
    - replaced unit creation process
        - removed get_num_allies() and get_num_enemies(), replaced by get_team()
        - get_team gets input string of units (represented by abbreviated class names) to be created and is called once for each team
    - added string representation for units
        - use str(unit) for "(name) the (class)" or unit.name for "(name)" only
    - minor changes to some output text
    - removed limits on some unit stats (via setters)
    - added Ability.clear_target()
        - called in Unit.downed(), finds every ability that targets the downed unit and calls remove_ability() on them
    - added Ability.remove_ability()
        - removes an ability's buff indicator (in unit's stack dict), reverts its effects, and removes the ability from queue 
        - stat-modifying buffs that go over their stack limit will have their effect added, and the oldest in the stack will revert its effect and be removed
    - Poison slightly reworked
        - two instance variables added in Units, PSN_DMG and PSN_count to help keep track of poison damage (still needs to use unit.target_Ability_queue)
    - some abilities are now "MAGIC" damage type, and rather than using target's DEF to lower damage, target's MAGIC is used instead
        - added MAGIC setter/getter

UPTO:  added unit.target_Ability_queue, get Poison to show accumulated damage in one line rather than in seperate lines for each stack
